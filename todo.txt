- Test, test, test
- test on TV
- analyze memory usage
- add performance monitoring
- add a settings dialog
- authentication
- basketball 14-15 error
- cleanup smugdata2.js
- move 2 versions to main
- add item navitgation when displaying media. i.e. arrow keys should move to new content
- keep some additional context about each data node so that we can go back to the select item
  - For example if I select item 15 in a container and that opens another container, when I go back to the original container item 15 should be selected
- implement something that allows us to release memory by deleting previously fetched nodes
  - this could also go along with modifying paging and saving the data from each page instead of the reload
